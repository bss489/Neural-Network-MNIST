# Neural-Network-MNIST
Objective is to compare the performance of various models using 2-hidden fully connected layers (Multilayer Perceptron) on MNIST dataset.
Following are the models used for performance measurements:
1. Sigmoid Activation + Adam Optimizer
2. ReLu Activation + Adam Optimizer
3. Sigmoid + Batch Normalization + Adam Optimizer
4. ReLu + DropOut + Adam Optimizer
