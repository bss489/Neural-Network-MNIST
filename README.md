# Neural-Network-MNIST
Objective is to compare the performance of various models using 2-hidden fully connected layers (Multilayer Perceptron) on MNIST dataset.
Following are the models used for performance measurements:
1. Sigmoid Activation + Adam Optimizer

Accuracy: 97.97%

2. ReLu Activation + Adam Optimizer 

Accuracy: 98.24

3. Sigmoid + Batch Normalization + Adam Optimizer 

Accuracy: 97.86

4. ReLu + DropOut + Adam Optimizer 

Accuracy: 97.93
